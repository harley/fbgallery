# FBGallery

A simple app that displays a facebook page's photo albums.

## Implementation notes

- Uses Angular.JS
- Parses json output received from the Facebook Graph API. E.g. https://graph.facebook.com/nike/albums

## Possible improvements

- Clicking on each album should render photos on the page instead of going to that album on facebook (or make this an option)
- Implement real-time search mode
